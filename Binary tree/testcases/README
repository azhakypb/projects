### Test Cases for HW15

This contains Makefile with each test case specified what it is testing.

We have tested your code both with running the bare code that you have submitted and also by grading just one function at a time. 
And then we have taken maximum score amongst them. If you have confusion with grading, you can contact the teaching staff.
The marks were as follows:
1. Main - 10 marks
2. Unsign2Bin - 30 marks
3. CreateBinary+WriteBinary func - 40 marks
